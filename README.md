# About this project

This repository has my work for Part A, found in the requirements.pdf file, of the Probability and Stochastic Processes course project back in Fall 2020, where It is required to create a GUI-based tool that allows a user to enter any stochastic process and outputs
ensemble and time statistics of that process. For more details about the project requirements, kindly check the requirements.pdf file, and also you can check the project report to see the results.
